## Description

Implemented Lidar Point Cloud processing techniques on the popular Apollo Lidar Point Cloud Obstacle Detection & Classification dataset using MATLAB. Some of the basic operations include visualizing the 3D point cloud colored by its reflective value, downsampling the 3D Point cloud to the 3D Voxel space points, visualizing the ground plane model using MSAC algorithm, visualizing the off ground points, visualizing the on ground points, visualizing the off ground points in X-Y plane, transforming the raw 3D point cloud from cartesian to polar coordinate, visualizing the 2D depth image in X-Y plane, visualizing the 2D depth image in Y-Z plane.  

The final output of the above said operations:
